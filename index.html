<h3 name="about-the-event" id="about-the-event">About the event</h3>

<p>The goal of this event is to promote the growth of problem solving skills and the collaboration among engineering students of all disciplines to solve real world problems. Very few events like this exist and it would be overwhelmingly beneficial not only to Mizzou engineering students but also to Mizzouâ€™s College of Engineering and companies looking to find students who are interested in personal growth in the engineering field and interested in tackling important engineering problems.</p>

<p>TigerBuilds is a two day event on the weekend of April 23 - 24. The event will begin on Saturday morning and will stretch into Sunday afternoon. Participants will be given an introduction to the event on Saturday providing a framework and the goals of the event. Participants will then break into teams of fellow engineering students (of any engineering discipline). </p>

<p>Once teams are formed they will then proceed to research common problems within industries/problem areas which include (but are not limited to) education, communication, transportation, water drought/conservation, disaster response/assistance, and crime monitoring/prevention. Sponsoring companies may also provide problems specific to their respective fields of work for participants to solve. Teams will have roughly a day to research, engineer, and develop their solutions within their diverse teams. Judging of solutions will be done by Mizzou Engineering professors and potentially sponsor company volunteers. </p>

<p>After judging ensues prize-winning solutions will be announced and teams will have the opportunity to present their solutions and collaborate further among members of different teams, faculty, and company representatives. This event has the potential to bring the benefits of already widely existing computer science HackaThons to all disciplines of engineering. Furthermore, and most importantly, this Interdisciplinary Engineering Hackathon provides students the opportunity to work across engineering disciplines which is priceless for real world application. </p>
